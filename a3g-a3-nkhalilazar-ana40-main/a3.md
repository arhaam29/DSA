The following are the chosen data structures: 
hash maps and binary search tree

**From the above links:**

$$Hash-table /vs/ Tries$$
Hash-tables are faster but tries are more flexible.
Tries have alphabetic order implementation.
For find function hash tables are better.
But, for print/return function tries are better
Both have same time complexity but hash table is faster due to hash values being ch3cked before actual values.
Thus, we can switch between hash tables and tries depending on our immediate requirements.

$$Trees /vs/ Tries$$
Tries are faster.
Trees stored data by only organising them as prefix.
Trees search every node if its binary its much faster but not as fast as tries.
Time complexity for trees is O(n log n) and for tries its O(n).
Thus, tries are better than Trees.
