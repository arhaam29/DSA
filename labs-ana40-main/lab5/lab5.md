* NEGAR KHALILAZAR

## Simple sorts

	* which algorithm did you find easiest to understand?
	**Ans: Insertion Sort**

	* which algorithm seemed to fastest for completing the sort?
	**Ans: Insertion Sort: $1min 54.37sec$**

	**Timings recorded:**
	*Insertion Sort: (Arhaam) $1min 54.37sec$
	*Selection Sort: (Alyssa) $2min 18.97sec$
	*Bubble Sort: (Negar) $3min 48.22sec$


## Merging Unsorted lists

	* how long did this take
	**Ans: $4min 30.33sec$**
	* did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)?
		* How many times? 
	**Ans: Yes, 6 times**


## Merging Sorted lists

	* how long did this take
	**Ans: $1min 50.10sec$**
	* did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)?
		* How many times?
	**Ans: Yes, 6 times**

## Sorting larger data sets

|Team member | Sorting time|
|---|---|
| Team member 1 | 55.01sec |
| Team member 2 | 1min 23.10sec |
| Team member 3 |  33.03sec|

What was fastest time?
**Ans: 33.03sec**

Describe the algorithm produced by the team member with fastest time.
**Ans: Divide the numbers in groups with each group containing numbers upto a specific limit, here
a limit of 10 for each group. For instance numbers 1-10 in one group, 11-20 in another group and so on. Sort each
group formed separately and then join them all together. Consequently, the numbers are sorted.**

## Partitioning

* how long did it take to partition the data set?
**Ans: 2min 03.33sec**


## Sorting the small piles

* how long did it take for you to sort all of the little piles?
**Ans: 1min 30.12sec**

## Putting it together

* As a team discuss things that helped soft the papers... what was useful? what was fast to do?  What was slow?
**Ans: Partitioning was useful but takes some time. Sorting small piles was fast and easier. Merging Unsorted lists was slow.**
* As a team come up with a description of how best to sort a set of numbers on paper.
**Ans: The best way would be to have partitioning but with small piles of specific ranges 1-10, 11-20 and so on. Then sorting these piles separately 
and joining them together as explained in the sorting of larger data sets.**
* Mix up all your numbers and have each member of the team perform the sort you did.  How long did it take?
**Ans: 
Arhaam: 33.03secs;
Alyssa: 36.21secs;
Negar: 30.69secs**
