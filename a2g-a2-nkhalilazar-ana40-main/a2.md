| find() - if item is not there | $O(n)$  |
| remove() - if item is there | $O(n^2)$  |
| copy constructor | $O(n^3)$  |
| move constructor | $O(1)$ |
| move assignment operator  | $O(n^3)$  |
| destructor  | $O(n^3)$  |



## Analysis
**Again: a proper analysis is required below**.

$$numRecords(): analysis$$

Assuming n as the size of records where records[i] = nullptr. 
T(n) is number of operations to get the num of records when there are n records.
''''cpp
int SimpleTable<TYPE>::numRecords() const{

    int rc=0;//1
    for(int i=0;records_[i]!=nullptr;i++){//1+3n+n
        rc++;//1*n
    }
    return rc;//1

}
''''

Thus, for num records T(n) = 1+1+4n+n+1 = 3+5n
Thus, T(n) is O(n). Linear time.

** ***************************** **

$$insert() : analysis$$
Assume n is num of records and T(n) is number of operations to insert a key value in the table when num records=n.

''''cpp
bool SimpleTable<TYPE>::insert(const std::string& key, const TYPE& value){

    int idx=-1;//1
    int sz=numRecords();//1+O(n) **run time of numRecords() function**
    bool rc=false;//1
    for(int i=0;i<sz;i++){//1+n+n
        if(records_[i]->key_ == key){//3n
            idx=i;//n
        }
    }
    if(idx==-1){//2
        if(sz == capacity_){//2
            grow();//O(n) **run time for grow() was found to be linear O(n)**
        }
        records_[numRecords()]=new Record(key,value);//3
        for (int i=0; i<sz-1; i++) { //1+n+n     
            for (int j=0; j<sz-1-i; j++){   1+n-1+n-1 (worst case i=0)
                if (records_[j+1]->key_ < records_[j]->key_) {    //3(n-1)*n
                    Record* tmp = records_[j];         //2n(n-1)    
                    records_[j] = records_[j+1];        //2n(n-1)
                    records_[j+1] = tmp;           //2n(n-1)
                }
            }
        }
        rc=true;//1
    }

    return rc;//1

}

**Check coments in code!!!**
We include complexity of numRecord() that is O(n).
Thus, for insert() function T(n) = 1+1+O(n)+2n+3n+n+2+2+O(n)+3+1+2n-1+2n+3n(n-1)+6n(n-1).
$T(n) ={ 9 +O(n)+O(n)+12n+3n^2-3n+6n^2-6n};$
$T(n)={9+O(n)+9n^2}={9+O(n)+O(n^2)}$
Thus, $T(n) is O(n^2)$.

** ***************************** **

$$modify : analysis$$

''''cpp
bool SimpleTable<TYPE>::modify(const std::string& key, const TYPE& value){

    int idx=-1;//1
    bool rc=false;//1
    for(int i=0;i<numRecords();i++){//1+O(n)*n+n = 1+n^2+n

**Check coments in code!!!**
We include complexity of numRecord() that is O(n) taken as n here for simpler calculation.
Thus, for find() T(n) = {6+4n+O(n)}. T(n) is $O(n)$.

** ***************************** **

$$remove() : analysis$$
Assume n is num of records and T(n) is number of operations 

''''cpp

**Check coments in code!!!**
We include complexity of numRecord() that is O(n) taken as n here for simpler calculation.
Thus, for remove() function $T(n)={3+7n+2n^2}.
T(n) is $O(n^2)$ .

$$copy constructor : analysis$$

    for(int i=0;i<rhs.numRecords();i++){//1+O(n)*n+n=1*n^2+n
        insert(rhs.records_[i]->key_,rhs.records_[i]->data_);//O(n^2)*n = n^3
    }

''''

**Check coments in code!!!**
We include complexity of numRecord() that is O(n) taken as n here for simpler calculation.
Thus, for copy constructor $T(n)={8+4*capcacity_+2n+n^3}.
Worst case assume n=capacity_.
Now, $T(n) = {8+5n+n^2+n^3}.
T(n) is $O(n^3)$.

$$move assignment operator: analysis$$
Assume n is num of records and T(n) is number of operations 

''''cpp

T(n) is $O(n^3)$ for move assignment operator.

# Part B

* Suggestion 1: For some of the functions (such as find, insert) that has a linear search, we could achieve a better time complexity if we used some other search method such as binary search to enhance them.
* Suggestion 2: For some functions (such as find, insert, remove) we can implement a boolean value that is turned true once the element's found so that it wouldn't go through the whole array all the time and the time complexity of these functions would be enhanced.
* Suggestion 3: Using a global variable that tracks the number of records instead of implementing a whole function to calulate it and loop through the whole array each time we went to access the number of records.

# Part D

## Experiment Description
We conducted two experiments:
* First with chaning value of Load Factor and the performance of find() from both LP and Chaining table.
In this experiment we took different values of numRecords and capacity and formed load factors in the increasing order starting from 0.1.
The plot shown in the graphs below has load factor on x axis and timings on y axis.
* Second with constant value of Load Factor at 0.1 but different numRecords and capacity, and the performance of find() from both LP and Chaining table.
In this experiment we took different values of numRecords and capacity but formed same load factor value of 0.1 ( a constant).
The plot shown in the graphs below has load factor on y axis because its a constant and timings on x axis. The values of num records and capacity can 
also be seen in the table of graphs for second experiment.

## Results
*How fast is find() function at the same load factor?
**Ans:**
At the same load factor, the find() function for LP table is always shown to be faster than the find() function for Chaining table.

*Does the load factor determine which table performs better?
**Ans:**
Yes. Load factor slightly effects the performance as we can see from experiment one greater load factor should much higher differnce in the time taken for the tables which 
lead to a conclusion that the LP table performs better. Thus, we can say that load factor can determine which table performs better.

*Summary:
* From the first experiment we can see that as the load factor increases the time taken also increases thus slowing the performance for both the tables.
* From the second experiment we can see that even at a constant load factor the time taken increases because of higher values of numrecords and capacity.
